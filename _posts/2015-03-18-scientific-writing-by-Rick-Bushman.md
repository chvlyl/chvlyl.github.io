[Dr.Rick Bushman](http://www.bushmanlab.org/) gave us a short lecture on scientific writing. I summarised the main points here:  
1. The simpler the better. Try to simplify your sentence and every dispensable word you remov increases clarity.  
2. Write in short sentences. Short sentences are much easier to read than long sentences and they help keep your own thoughs in order.  
3. Start paragraphs with short topic sentences.  A topic sentence should introduce and summarize what follows in the paragraph.  
4. End paragraphs with summary sentences.  
5. Avoid using "very, interestingly, strikingly, novel". Let readers conclude for themselves.
6. Avoid starting sentences with long clauses.  
7. Don't over-condense your writing. In math, it is common to see phrases like "the rest of the proof is obvious".  
8. Never use a long word where a short one will do.  
9. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut if out.  
10. Never use the passive where you can use the active.  
11. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientic word, or a jargon word if you can thknk of an everyday English equivalent.  

Rick also recommended two books:  
1. On Writing Well by William Zinsser.  
2. The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White.
