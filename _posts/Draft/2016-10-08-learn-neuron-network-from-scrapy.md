title: "Learn Neural Network from scratch"

Nowadays, everyone in the machine learning community are talking about Neural Networks (NN). I have zero knowledge about NN but it seems to me this is a very powerful model that can solve very complicated problems that other machine learning methods can not. 

"Neural Network is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it"

So I decided to spend time learning this model.
