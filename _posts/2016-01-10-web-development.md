I'm learning web development and here are my study notes.

## Part 1: How to earn money by making websites?

### Brand Yourself
-. Match your personal expertise to your website so that your website can be useful to other people. Your website will be more than a website.
-. Build your online reputation by advertising yourself and your website on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn , personal website and email.

### Use Freelance Websites
-. www.freelancer.com/
-. https://www.upwork.com
-. https://www.peopleperhour.com/
-. https://www.elance.com/
-. http://www.guru.com/
-. http://www.gofreelance.com/

1. At the beginning, focus on gainning good reviews rather than earning money. Therefore it is necessary to start with small project and bid with lower rate.
2. Use your real identity to create the profile and put your personal website, LinkedIn profile and Twitter to you. 
3. Bid for small project and finish it.


### Use Wordpress to build attractive website
1. Get familiar with the templates and themes at http://themeforest.net/
2. Build your own website with those website templates and themes. Use your website as the showcase.
3. Create websites for friends and other people. You can also go to whatever forums to make websites for people over there. Use these websites as your showcase.
4. Find some poorly designed pages for some local small business and redo them. Send the design to them. Add these websites to your showcase too.
5. After gain enough showcase, bid on those website development jobs on the freelance site.


### Make the profitable website
1. If you have spent time looking for something and you didn't find it, then someone else may have done the same thing. Or if you feel something you have just done can be done more easily, then probably someone else also has the same feeling. This is a good start point to make your profitable website. The needs of majority people are satified my mainstream product but there are always some specific needs from a small group people. You should target those people.
2. Build a preliminary website to make your idea work. Add google analytics to your website to monitor your website traffic.
3. Find out what are the core features that people are willing to pay for. Choose a small subset of people to try out and ask them for feedback. Improve your website until you get a great number of people who are willing to pay for it. Keep doing this.
4. Put relevant ads on your website.
