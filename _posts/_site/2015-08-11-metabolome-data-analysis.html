<h4 id="lc-ms">LC-MS</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry: detect the mass-to-charge raio (m/z) and the retention time</li>
  <li>Chromatography is used to separate organic and inorganic compoundns. Liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) 
are two common chromatography approaches.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="retention-time">Retention time</h4>
<p>The time that a compound elutes out of the column in chromatography is called retention time. The eluted compounds are then injected
into the mass spectrometer.</p>

<h4 id="mass-spectrometer">Mass spectrometer</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Ion source: converts eletrically neural compounds into charged molecules. It is often to analyze the biological samples in 
both +ve(positive) and -ve(negative) ionization modes to cover more metabolites.</li>
  <li>Mass analyzer: separates ions according to the m/z values. Usually, more than one mass analyzer are used in tandem mass spectrometry.</li>
  <li>Detector: converts the abundances of the ions into the electrical signals.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="lc-ms-raw-data">LC-MS raw data</h4>
<p>Since samples are separated by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, the LC-MS raw data is three dimentional 
(retention time, mass-to-charge ratio, intensity)
1. Retention time: the time that the metabolite elutes from the liquid chromatography.
2. Mass-to-charge raio (m/z): measurement of the molecular weight.
3. Intensity: quantification of the metabolite abundance.</p>

<h4 id="lc-msms">LC-MS/MS</h4>
<p>The parent ions are broken into smaller fragments. The MS/MS spectrum (tandem MS) can provide the information about 
both product ions and the remaining parent ion. Therefore, metabolites with the same mass but different structures can be identified.</p>

<h4 id="lc-ms-data-preprocessing">LC-MS data preprocessing</h4>
<p>Remove outliers, detect peaks orrepsongding to metabolites and align peaks across multimple samples.</p>
