<p><a href="http://www.bushmanlab.org/">Dr.Rick Bushman</a> gave us a short lecture on scientific writing. I summarised the main points here:<br />
1. The simpler the better. Try to simplify your sentence and every dispensable word you remov increases clarity.<br />
2. Write in short sentences. Short sentences are much easier to read than long sentences and they help keep your own thoughs in order.<br />
3. Start paragraphs with short topic sentences.  A topic sentence should introduce and summarize what follows in the paragraph.<br />
4. End paragraphs with summary sentences.<br />
5. Avoid using “very, interestingly, strikingly, novel”. Let readers conclude for themselves.
6. Avoid starting sentences with long clauses.<br />
7. Don’t over-condense your writing. In math, it is common to see phrases like “the rest of the proof is obvious”.<br />
8. Never use a long word where a short one will do.<br />
9. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut if out.<br />
10. Never use the passive where you can use the active.<br />
11. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientic word, or a jargon word if you can thknk of an everyday English equivalent.</p>

<p>Rick also recommended two books:<br />
1. On Writing Well by William Zinsser.<br />
2. The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White.</p>
