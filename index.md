I am a PhD student in Genomics and Computational Biology at University of Pennsylvania. I'm currently working with [Prof.Hongzhe Li in Biostatistics Department](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/) on statistical methods for metagenomic data anlaysis. My current research foucuses on studying the microbiome in the human gut and developing statistical and computational tools for microbiome data analysis. Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-zhang-chen-a31bab16) and [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7mrZzpYAAAAJ&hl=en).



Besides my research, I'm also a big fan of data science. That is, use machine learning and statistical approaches to extra useful information from massive data. I use R and Python in my everyday work and I also know Java and C++. Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/chvlyl) and [Kaggle website](). If you need expert on data analysis, please feel free to contact me.

I'm also a web developer and Andorid/iOS app developer.

I'd like to keep challenging myself and I like learning new things. I'm also interested in finance and investments and passed the CFA ([Chartered Financial Analyst](https://www.cfainstitute.org/pages/index.aspx)) Level 1 exam.
