I'm a data scientist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. I analyze Electronic Health Records (EHR) data as well as operational data with advanced machine learning and statistical methods to improve the healthcare in the hospital. I received my Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania, under the supervision of [Hongzhe Li in Biostatistics Department](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/) . My research mainly focused on statistical methods for metagenomic data anlaysis. I have 14 publications and over 900 citations of my work. I also hold a [US patent for trisomy 13 and 18 diagnosis](http://www.google.com/patents/EP2825991A4?cl=en). Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-zhang-chen-a31bab16) and [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7mrZzpYAAAAJ&hl=en).


Besides my research, I'm also a big fan of data science.  I use R and Python in my everyday work and I also know Java and C++. Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/chvlyl) and [Kaggle website](). 



I'm also interested in financial investments and passed the CFA ([Chartered Financial Analyst](https://www.cfainstitute.org/pages/index.aspx)) Level 1 exam.
