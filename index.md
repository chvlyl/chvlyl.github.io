I am a PhD student in Genomics and Computational Biology at University of Pennsylvania. I'm currently working with [Prof.Hongzhe Li in Biostatistics Department](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/) on statistical methods for metagenomic data anlaysis. My current research foucuses on studying the microbiome in the human gut and developing statistical and computational tools for microbiome data analysis. I have 14 publications and over 700 citations of my work. I also hold a [US patent for trisomy 13 and 18 diagnosis](http://www.google.com/patents/EP2825991A4?cl=en). Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-zhang-chen-a31bab16) and [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7mrZzpYAAAAJ&hl=en).


Besides my research, I'm also a big fan of data science. That is, use machine learning and statistical approaches to extra useful information from massive data. I use R and Python in my everyday work and I also know Java and C++. Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/chvlyl) and [Kaggle website](). If you need help on data analysis, please feel free to contact me.
