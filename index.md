I'm a data scientist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. My work involves analyzing patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, image data, clinical text data as well as hospital operational data using advanced machine learning and statistical methods to improve the healthcare in the hospital. I'm particularly interested in deep learning, natural language processing and image analysis. I have successfully applied those techniques to the EHR data, surgery note text data and eye image data and solved the real-world problems. I received my Ph.D. from University of Pennsylvania, under the supervision of [Hongzhe Li in Biostatistics Department](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/). My PhD research mainly focused on statistical methods for metagenomic data anlaysis. I have 17 publications with over 1000 citations of my work and hold a [US patent for trisomy 13 and 18 diagnosis](http://www.google.com/patents/EP2825991A4?cl=en). Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-zhang-chen-a31bab16) and [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7mrZzpYAAAAJ&hl=en).


 I'm also interested in financial investments and passed the CFA ([Chartered Financial Analyst](https://www.cfainstitute.org/pages/index.aspx)) Level 1 exam.

I have a friend who is a PhD student in Philosophy. His research is focused on biology. But unlike a biologist, he is studying biology from a philosophical point of view. We chat a lot about Philosophy, especially those thought experiments about AI, for example, the famous Chinese Room thought experiment. I became interested in Philosophy and asked his recommendation for a beginnerâ€™s book. This a the book he recommended. 


* [Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Age-Statistical-Inference-Mathematical/dp/1107149894)
