Recently, I read this paper [Ten Simple Rules for Writing Science from PloS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004205). I found this paper gives very practical tips on writing scientific papers. I summarized those tips as below (some sentences are directly copied from the ariticle). 

>1. Keep it short
>
>2. Keep it compact: keep sentences or phrasing short, break compound sentences into simpler sentences, and remove any “unnecessary” words
>
>3. Keep it simple:  use plain language and avoid jargon and technical terms
>
>4. Use the present tense: it is more direct and deemed easier to understand for non-native speakers
>
>5. Avoid adjectives and adverbs: Use few adjectives and adverbs avoids fluff and keep the text short and easy to understand
>
>6. Focus: stick to a single point, and reiterate the “take home” message
>
>7. Signal Novelty and Importance: explicitly state the significance of your work
>
>8. Be Bold: sell the work forcefully and stress positive results
>
>9. Show Confidence: using too many “hedge words” (e.g., “somewhat”, “speculative”, “appear”, “almost", “largely”) can signal a lack of confidence in the work. 
>
>10. Avoid Evocative Words: words perceived as “pleasant”, “active” or “easy to imagine”
