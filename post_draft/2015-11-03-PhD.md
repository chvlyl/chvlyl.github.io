### [PHD Grind by Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf)   
I happened to find Philip Guo's book about his PhD journal. After reading it, I found this book is very inspiring. 
1. Find ideas by solving real problems.  
2. Find ideas by working with other people (professors, students).
