### Install Android Studio
First, we need a tool for Android App development. Download [Android Studio]](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio) and install it on your computer. If you don't have Java SDK, go to the next step.

### Install Java SE Development Kit 
Since, we need Java Development Kit (JDK) for Android App development, you also need to download and install the latest Java JDK. Download and install it from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

### Install Android SDK packages
Next, we need some Android SDK tools for App development. Start Android Studio and find SDK Manager. Click "SDK Tools" tab and make sure the following packages have been installed:

- Android SDK Tools
- Android SDK Platform-tools
- Android SDK Build-tools

### A toy example

1. Open a new project. We don't need to change anything and just click "Next". In the "Activity" section, choose "Blank Activity" and click "Next". Click "Next" until the Android Studio starts to build the app.
