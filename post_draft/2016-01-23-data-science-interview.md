## Dynamic programming
1. Dynamic programming (DP) is a type of algorithm used to solve a specific type of problems. 
2. It is similar to divide and conquer method that solves a problem by iteratively solve some subproblems. However, dynamic programming is different from divide and conquer method in a way that the subproblmes are independent in divide and conquer but overlapped in dynamic programming. 
3. Dynamic programming saves the results for solving each subproblem so that in the next iteration, the same subproblem does not need to be calculated again. 
4. The problem can be solved by dynamic programming must have the following features: it must has optimization structure. That is the problem is to optimize something such as finding the max value. It can be decomposed into overlapped subproblems.   

DP = "careful brute force" = subprolbmes + "reuse"
